\begin{frame}{Automatic test case generation}
	How can I sufficiently test my code without writing hundreds of cases?
	\xxx
	\begin{block}{Idea}
		Automatically generate input values.
	\end{block}	

	$\Rightarrow$ Problem: How can we know the correct output, if the input is randomly generated?
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Property-based Testing}
	\begin{block}{Property-based Testing}
		Define properties and criteria for outputs that should be true for any arbitrary inputs.
		If the properties hold for big number of generated inputs, we assume that the code is correct.
	\end{block}	

		
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Property-based Testing}
	Example: Test a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum of them.
	\xxx
	\begin{block}{Exercise}
		Find three properties that are true for adding two numbers and that are not true for other mathematical operators $(-,*,/)$.
	\end{block}	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Property-based Testing}
	
	\begin{block}{Property 1}
		Adding $1$ to any numbers twice has the same result as adding $2$. (Associative Property)
	\end{block}	

	\begin{block}{Property 2}
		Adding number $a$ to number $b$ has the same result as adding $b$ to $a$. (Commutative Property)
	\end{block}	
	
	\begin{block}{Property 3}
		Adding $0$ to any numbers $a$ results in $a$. (Neutral Element)
	\end{block}	
	\xxx
	These three properties can be checked for every random generated input.\\
	
	$\Rightarrow$ A more complex example will be introduced in the exercises.
