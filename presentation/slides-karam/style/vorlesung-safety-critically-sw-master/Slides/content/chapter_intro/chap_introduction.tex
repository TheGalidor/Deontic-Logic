\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Safety and Reliability}

\begin{frame}{Safety-Critical and Reliable Software Systems}
		\begin{beameritemize}
		\item We trusts our lives on software-based systems on a daily basis. 
		\item For example in planes, cars, medical devices, nuclear engineering...
		\item There are a lot of methods and techniques that aim to bring the risk of using such system to a minimal level and thereby increasing the software quality.
	\end{beameritemize}	

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Safety-Critical and Reliable Software Systems}
	Methods and techniques:
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Legal and regulatory requirements
		\item Standards for the software development process (coding, inspecting, documenting, analyzing)		
		\item Wide range of verification techniques (including formal methods)
	\end{beameritemize}	
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Safety-Critical and Reliable Software Systems}
	
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Safety-critical systems are increasingly complex and interconnected.
		\item Assistance systems take over increasingly more responsibilities (parking-assistance, autonomous driving, smart home, ...).
		\item Faults in these systems are dangerous and can potentially harm and kill people.
	\end{beameritemize}	
	
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What is ...?}
Safety:
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Sicherheit(german) = Safety + Security
		\item We consider safety in context of functional safety, not in context of security against attacks.	
	\end{beameritemize}	
Risk:
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Quantification of danger.
		\item Consequence of a hazard, combined with the likelihood of it occurring.
	\end{beameritemize}	
Reliability:
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
		\item Reliability $=1-$ Probability of Failure
	\end{beameritemize}	
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Development of Safety-Critical Software}
	
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Goal: Reduce risk and increase reliability to a reasonable amount.
		\item Therefore different tasks of validation and verification have to be performed.
		\item International norms are defined to assure that these tasks are actually performed.
		\begin{beameritemize}
			\item IEC 61508: Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems 
			\item ISO 26262: Functional Safety of Road Vehicles
			\item IEC 62061: Functional Safety of Machines
			\item DO 178C: Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification
		\end{beameritemize}
	\end{beameritemize}	
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Validation and Verification}
	\begin{Block}{Validation}
		\enquote{Are we building the right product?} \newline
		(Does the system meet the clientâ€™s expectations?)
	\end{Block}
	
	\begin{Block}{Verification}
		\enquote{Are we building the product right?} \newline
		(Does the system meet its specification?)
	\end{Block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Development of Safety-Critical Software}
	This course focuses the following content:
	\begin{beameritemize}
		\item Defining software quality and ways to increase it (Later this Chapter)
		\item Verification techniques/Formal methods:
		\begin{beameritemize}
			\item Testing (Chapter \ref{chap_testing})
			\item Static Program Analysis (Chapter \ref{chap_static})
			\item Model Checking (Chapter \ref{chap_mc})
			\item Theorem Proving (Chapter \ref{chap_theorem})
			\item Runtime Verification (Chapter \ref{chap_rv})
		\end{beameritemize}
		\item Interesting trends in programming languages (i.e. RUST and Spark, Chapter \ref{chap_languages}) 
		\item Usage of specification languages for formal methods (Chapter \ref{chap_spec})
		\item Domain-specific legal and regulatory requirements (Chapter \ref{chap_certification})
	\end{beameritemize}

\begin{frame}{Embedded Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems}
	
	\begin{block}{Embedded Systems}
		Embedded Systems are computers that are integrated in a larger technical context and performing tasks such as control, regulation, monitoring, signal processing, etc..
	\end{block}

	$\Rightarrow$ 90\% of all computers are embedded systems.

\begin{frame}{Embedded Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems}	

	\begin{block}{Cyber-physical Systems}
		In cyber-physical systems, physical and software components are deeply intertwined, each operating on different spatial and temporal scales, exhibiting multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interacting with each other in a lot of ways that change with context.
	\end{block}
